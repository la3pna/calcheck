OpenT-check T-check software for VNA

Accepts *.s2p files formatted in:
* R+jX
* Mag + Phase 
* dB + angle

Reads the data and does processing on the vectors in order to determine the T-check. 

The program binarys are avaible in the calcheck - alpha folder. Software should run with the mono runtime environment on linux, BSD, solaris, OSx (mac) and apparently Playstation 3 (who would want that?)
